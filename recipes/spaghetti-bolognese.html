    <p>
      Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food.
      Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a
      mixture of ground veal and beef. You can also substitute the balsamic
      vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.

    <h4>How to Prepare</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the
        spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the
        bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in
        the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot,
        and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin
        to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until
        fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable
        mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer
        pink, 8 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer
        until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes,
        tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; bring the mixture
        to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. Stir
        the fresh basil into the mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to
        serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
