    <h4>How to Prepare</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil. </li>
        <li>Cut peppers in half and remove stems, seeds, and membranes. Place peppers onto the prepared baking sheet with the cut-sides down. </li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until skins are blackened, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer peppers to a paper bag. Seal the bag and let rest for 15 minutes. Remove from the bag and rub to remove peels, then chop and divide into two equal portions. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, 1/2 of the peppers, paprika, thyme, and sugar. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until tomato juices have evaporated, about 25 minutes. </li>
